## 🧠 What I Do

🔹 **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
Using `Pandas`, `NumPy`, and `OpenPyXL` to clean, transform, and prepare datasets for analysis.

🔹 **Data Analysis & EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
Performing deep data explorations with Python, `Jupyter`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn`.

🔹 **SQL & Databases**  
Working with `SQLite`, `PostgreSQL`, and `MySQL` to run complex queries, build dashboards, and extract insights.

🔹 **Web Scraping & Data Collection**  
Extracting data from websites using `BeautifulSoup`, `Requests`, and `Selenium`.

🔹 **Data Visualization**  
Creating professional visualizations using `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Plotly`, and dashboards with `Streamlit`.

🔹 **Big Data & Cloud Environments** (In Progress 💻)  
Exploring tools like `Apache Spark`, `Hadoop`, and using cloud platforms like `Google Colab`, `Kaggle`, `AWS`, and `Azure`.

🔹 **Machine Learning** (Learning Phase 🤖)  
Understanding ML fundamentals with `Scikit-learn` and working toward building simple models and predictions.
